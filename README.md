# The Problem with Ridesharing

- Uber drivers have been complaining that the gap between the fare a rider pays and what the driver receives is getting wider. They're making less and less each year, with many of them making less than minimum wage.

- Uber's official statement stated that they're charging some passengers more because they need the extra cash.

- Uber applies machine-learning techniques to estimate how much groups of customers are willing to shell out for a ride..

- For instance, someone traveling from a wealthy neighborhood to another tony spot might be asked to pay more than another person heading to a poorer part of town, even if demand, traffic and distance are the same.

- Ridesharing companies love to hook potential drivers by saying "be your own boss". This is a straight up lie. Real entrepreneurs or "bosses" are able to compete in an open marketplace where they can set their own pricing and the terms of the transaction. Ridesharing today is controlled by one central company, which controls how much drivers make(which is very little), and they control the whole marketplace.

- Drivers face massive pay cuts overnight with no warning, and must conduct business ‘their way’ or not at all. These companies can control everything that happens on their platform, making it oppressive to the actual users.

- Centralization makes Uber vulnerable to legal actions, since it's a centralized server, and there is the possibility that it could be shut down any time. A good example is in Austin, Texas.

-On top of that, there is a lack of transparency between rideshare drivers and rideshare passengers, which results in rideshare assaults, and various other crimes. Rideshare drivers can't trust their passengers and vice versa.

# Introducing Bluber: A blockchain based ridesharing service

- Imagine a community where the users can interact with each other, vote on ideas surrounding the future of the community.
- Users of Bluber would achieve consensus on any decisions democratically
- Lets shift the decision making power to the drivers with respect to pricing.

## Blockchain?

- Blockchain is useful for 3 properties:

1. Immutability: nothing written to the blockchain can be changed
2. Persistence: everyone has a copy so you can't lose all your data
3. Decentralized: no need to rely on a central authority for information

With this, Bluber drivers can:

- Earn equity
- Set their own rates
- Negotiate and transact directly with riders
- Build direct relationships with riders for a stable and recurring customer base
- Self-organize into ‘pods’, co-ops, or their own businesses

# Smart Contracts: a tool for maximum transparency and security

- Smart contracts are used for
1. Drivers posting their destination and departure details.
2. Drivers will state when and where they are going.
3. Users will be able to sign up for a ride by paying their share of the estimated cost and then wait to be picked up by the driver
- Smart contracts contain all the information such  as rider name, age, location, ride price and where they would like to travel.
- All data is  encrypted on the Ethereum blockchain.
- A driver offering a ride will view that information, schedule a ride and then choose a date and time to confirm. The driver will then confirm the ride.
- Once the driver confirms the ride a new transaction is initiated that will broadcast the confirmation and driver information to the Ethereum blockchain.
- This smart contract will contain information on both the rider and driver. This information will be used to match the rider with their most preferred modes of transportation. This way, ridesharing doesn't have to be with a car anymore.

# Bluber tokens +Smart Contracts
Ridesharing via Smart Contracts

The goal is to create a web application that will allow users to buy rides without the middle man. A person looking for a ride would put out their request along with a price they are willing to pay. Drivers would see a list of available ride requests and would initiate the contract to verify that the ride is completed. Smart contracts ensure maximum security between transactions, and transparency between the driver and the rider, by ensuring each person knows about the other.

Tokens are rewarded proportional to the length of the rides drivers fulfill.

Bluber is an awesome project, and there's still so much to do! Here are my next steps:

-embed google maps
-implement AI to track riders, and their location.
